Implement the „*free group*” algebraic stucture as a list of pairs consisting of a „sign” and a „symbol”.
The sign can be mimicked by a **`bool`**, and the symbol by a **`nat`**.
Proof all interesting theorems of group theory, at least the following ones:

- Neutral element:
    - there is a neutral element (from both sides)
    - there are no more neutral elements
- Inverse element:
    - for any given element, there is an inverse element (from both sides)
    - there are no more inverse elements
- Other theorems:
    - for any given two elements, there is a quotient elemet, with whom the product brings the first element into the second one.

Implement the Fourier-Motzkin elimination in Agda, and prove the most important theorems, so that the uer can be conviced that the Fourier-Motzkin elimination is a suitable algorithm to do collision detection in simpler game programs and floor-plan graphical editor programs. Make a compilation to have a JavaScript output to be embedded in a practical web application!
